# Image Analysis for Shakoor Lab Sorghum/Fonio Lines

Code Repo for different Image Analysis techniques of our NS_00X trials using Donald Danforth's Data Science Team's in house created software, called PlantCV. This software was built to run images of plants through it to obtain different values such as RGB, Hyperspectral, and Morphological characteristics of plants being studied.

## Python with PlantCV

For this project, I used interactive coding environments in the cloud (Jupyter notebook) and I worked with image data in Python using PlantCV and other open-source tools.
